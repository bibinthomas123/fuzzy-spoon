        is key to allowing sunlight to reach the plants within.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong className="heading1">Gathering the Essentials:</strong> <br />
        To create a thriving terrarium, you will need a few essential supplies.
        These include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            a. Pebbles or small rocks: These act as a drainage layer at the
            bottom of your terrarium, preventing waterlogging and promoting
            healthy root growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            b. Activated charcoal: Charcoal helps filter the air within the
            terrarium and prevents any unpleasant odors caused by excess
            moisture.
          </li>
          <li>
            c. Potting soil: Choose a well-draining soil mix suitable for indoor
            plants. Avoid using garden soil, as it may retain too much moisture.
          </li>
          <li>
            d. Assorted plants: Opt for small plants that thrive in humid
            environments and have similar light and water requirements. Popular
            choices include ferns, mosses, succulents, and air plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            e. Decorative elements (optional): Add a touch of personal flair
            with decorative items like small figurines, pebbles, or pieces of
            driftwood. Let your imagination guide you.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong className="heading1">Building the Layers:</strong> <br />
        Now comes the fun part â€“ creating layers within your terrarium. Follow
        these steps:
        <ul>
          <li>
            a. Start with a 1-2 inch layer of pebbles at the bottom to promote
            drainage.
          </li>
          <li>
            b. Add a thin layer of activated charcoal to keep the terrarium
            fresh and odor-free.
          </li>
          <li>
            c. Carefully add the potting soil, leaving enough space for your
            plants to be comfortably nestled.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong className="heading1">Planting and Arranging:</strong> <br />
        The arrangement of your plants is key to the visual appeal of your
        terrarium. Consider the varying heights, colors, and textures of the
        plants for an eye-catching display. Gently remove the plants from their
        containers, loosen the roots, and plant them in the soil. Create a
        harmonious composition by placing taller plants at the back and smaller
        ones toward the front. Feel free to rearrange until you achieve your
        desired look.
        <br />
        <br />

    title: "Mental Health: It's Time to Break the Stigma",
    paragraph: (
      <>
        Mental health is a topic that many people tend to avoid or overlook, but
        it's time to break the stigma and start talking about it. Mental health
        affects everyone, regardless of age, gender, or social status. It's not
        something that should be hidden or ignored, as it can have a profound
        impact on our lives and the lives of those around us.
        <br />
        <br />
        When we talk about mental health, we often think about conditions like
        depression and anxiety. While these are certainly important aspects of
        mental health, it's important to remember that mental health encompasses
        a wide range of issues, including trauma, addiction, eating disorders,
        and more.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the biggest challenges we face when it comes to mental health is
        the stigma that surrounds it. Many people are reluctant to seek help or
        talk about their struggles because they fear being judged or
        misunderstood. This can lead to feelings of isolation and shame, which
        can only make things worse.
        <br />
        <br />
        But here's the thing: mental health is just as important as physical
        health. It's not a weakness or a flaw, and it's not something that can
        be simply "fixed" with a positive attitude or a stiff upper lip. It
        requires compassion, understanding, and support.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you're struggling with your mental health, know that you're not
        alone. There are resources available to you, including therapy, support
        groups, and hotlines. And if you're worried about someone else, reach
        out to them with kindness and empathy. Let them know that you care and
        that you're there for them.
        <br />
        <br />
        We all have a role to play in breaking the stigma surrounding mental
        health. By being open and honest about our struggles, we can help create
        a culture of acceptance and understanding. Let's start talking, and
        let's start healing.

        challenges. Consider the fear of disease and the subsequent development
        of modern medicine, or the fear of famine leading to advancements in
        agriculture. Fear has compelled humans to seek solutions and find ways
        to overcome obstacles, propelling us forward in countless fields.

        Fear has not only influenced technological and scientific progress but
        has also played a significant role in shaping our social structures.
        Fear of social exclusion and ostracism has led to the establishment of
        norms, ethics, and governance systems, fostering cooperation and
        creating cohesive societies. Fear of inequality and injustice has
        sparked social movements and struggles for equality, leading to
        significant societal advancements. <br />

        While fear has propelled us forward, it also has a darker side that can
        impede progress. Fear of change, fear of the unknown, and fear of losing
        power or control have hindered social and scientific advancements
        throughout history. Resistance to new ideas and perspectives has often
        stemmed from a place of fear, stifling innovation and limiting our
        collective potential. <br />

    title: "The Thousand Splendid Suns- My All Time Favorite Book",
    paragraph: (
      <>
        The Thousand Splendid Suns" by Khaled Hosseini is my favorite book, a
        powerful and emotionally resonant tale that takes us on a journey
        through the lives of two women in war-torn Afghanistan. Hosseini's
        captivating storytelling transports us into the lives of Mariam and
        Laila, two vastly different women brought together by fate and bonded by
        their resilience, love, and shared experiences. Through their eyes, we
        witness the struggles, sacrifices, and resilience of Afghan women in a
        society plagued by violence, oppression, and inequality. The book
        beautifully captures the complexity of human relationships, the strength
        of the human spirit, and the power of hope in the face of adversity. It
        is a poignant and thought-provoking novel that shines a light on the
        untold stories of women and their indomitable spirit in the midst of a
        harsh and unforgiving world. "The Thousand Splendid Suns" is a
        masterpiece that left a lasting impact on me, reminding me of the
        indescribable strength that resides within individuals, even in the
        darkest of times.
